Datasets, Java code and Spark notebook of Watcher-AI.

## Structure
- spark-notebook-resources: the spark notebook file

- watcher-trainer: a Scala project to train and compare ML models

- watcher-ai-samples: a Java application wich uses the trained ML models to predict values


To start this notebook in your environment, please follow this steps:

* Step 1 : [Download this version of Spark Notebook](http://spark-notebook.io/dl/zip/0.6.3/2.10/1.6.0/2.6.0/true/true)
